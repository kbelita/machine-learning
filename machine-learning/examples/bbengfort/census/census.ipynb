    "# Building a Classifier from Cenus Data\n",
    "**An end-to-end machine learning example using Pandas and Scikit-Learn** \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the machine learning workshops given to students in the [Georgetown Data Science Certificate](http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/data-science/) is to build a classification, regression, or clustering model using one of the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html) datasets. The idea behind the workshop is to ingest data from a website, perform some initial analyses to get a sense for what's in the data, then structure the data to fit a Scikit-Learn model and evaluate the results. Although the repository does give advice as to what types of machine learning might be applied, this workshop still poses a challenge, especially in terms of data wrangling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll outline how I completed this workshop alongside my students this past weekend. For those new to machine learning or to Scikit-Learn, I hope this is a practical example that may shed light on many challenges that crop up developing predictive models. For more experienced readers, I hope that I can challenge you to try this workshop, and to contribute iPython notebooks with your efforts as tutorials! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the workshop is to use the UCI Machine Learning Repository to find a non-trivial dataset with which to build a model. While the example datasets included with Scikit-Learn are good examples of how to fit models, they do tend to be either trivial or overused. By exploring a novel dataset with several (more than 10) features and many instances (more than 10,000), I was hoping to conduct a predictive exercise that could show a bit more of a challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are around 350 datasets in the repository, categorized by things like task, attribute type, data type, area, or number of attributes or instances. I ended up choosing a [Census Income](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) dataset that had 14 attributes and 48,842 instances. The task listed was a binary classifier to build a model that could determine from census information whether or not the person made more than $50k per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset in the repository comes with a link to the data folder, which I simply clicked and downloaded to my computer. However, in an effort to make it easier for you to follow along, I've included a simple `download_data` function that uses `requests.py` to fetch the data. "

Using this object to manage our data will mirror the native API and allow us to easily copy and paste code that demonstrates classifiers and technqiues with the built in datasets. Importantly, this API will also allow us to communicate to other developers and our future-selves exactly how to use the data. \n",

In the case of the `LabelEncoder`, the `fit` method discovers all unique elements in the given vector, orders them lexicographically, and assigns them an integer value. These values are actually the indices of the elements inside the `LabelEncoder.classes_` attribute, which can also be used to do a reverse lookup of the class name from the integer value. \n",
