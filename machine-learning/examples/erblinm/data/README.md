# Predict where Patients in Post-Operative areas should be sent next


Download, explore, and wrangle the Post-Operative Patients dataset with an eye toward developing a predictive model for where patients should be sent next.


## STEP ONE: EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
Start by cloning this repository.



### Things to think about
1. How to explore a new dataset?
2. What to look for in tabular data?
3. What visualization tools can you use to help you explore?
4. What is the end goal of data wrangling? Why are we even doing this?
5. What to clean and how to clean it?

## STEP TWO: MACHINE LEARNING FROM DISASTER
_(You will do this portion in the Machine Learning course.)_      

The iPython Notebook for this project is called "Post-Operative.ipynb." 
If you haven't already installed Scikit-learn, do that now.    


__MAC OSX USERS__:

pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn




Problems with installation? Check out: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

If you get hung up with the installation or the repo update, you can also get the gist:     https://gist.github.com/rebeccabilbro/d40599f4ec96aa21dc48
